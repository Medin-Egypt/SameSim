#  VR Surgical Simulation                 
High-fidelity surgical training system for Unity with realistic tissue deformation, precision cutting mechanics, and full VR controller integration.              
# Overview                                       
VR Surgical Simulation is a complete Unity framework for creating realistic surgical training experiences. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, it provides soft-body tissue physics, precision cutting tools, and natural hand interactions.
Perfect for:

* Medical training applications
* VR educational experiences
* Surgical procedure simulation
* Healthcare skill development
# Features
**Realistic Tissue Deformation**

* Elastic Mesh System: Realistic soft-body physics for organic tissue
* Material Transitions: Dynamic skin-to-flesh material changes during cutting
* Permanent Deformation: Cut areas retain their deformation state
* Edge Anchoring: Natural tissue behavior with edge stabilization

**Surgical Tools:**

* Scalpel Controller: Full VR controller integration with haptic feedback
* Pick & Place: Natural tool handling with smooth return-to-position  
* Cutting Mechanics: Raycast-based precision cutting system  
* Tool Radius Control: Adjustable influence area for each tool
